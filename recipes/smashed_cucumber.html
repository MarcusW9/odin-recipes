                <li>3 cloves garlic, grated or zested</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons rice vinegar</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons chili oil with spices</li>
                <li>1 1/2 teaspoons sugar</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons sesame oil</li>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Slice off the ends of the cucumbers. Then, slice the cucumbers in half, lengthwise.</li>
                <li>Place the cucumber halves, cut side down. Then place the side of the knife over the cucumber. Using the fleshy part of your palm, smack the knife to smash the cucumber until it splits. Make sure to smash along the entire length of the cucumber. Then, slice the cucumbers diagonally, about 1/2-inch thick slices. Transfer the cucumber pieces to a bowl.</li>
                <li>Sprinkle a pinch of kosher salt over the cucumbers and mix. Let the cucumbers sit for 20 minutes. Then, drain out the excess water at the bottom of the bowl. (See note 5) You do not need to rinse the cucumbers. (See note 6)</li>
                <li>Add the grated/zested garlic to a bowl and mix it with the rice vinegar. Let that sit for 10 to 15 minutes to mellow out the raw bite of the garlic.</li>
                <li>Add the soy sauce, 2 tablespoons of chili oil (with bits of pepper and spices), sugar, and sesame oil.</li>
                <li>Right before you are ready to serve the cucumber salad, toss the cucumber pieces with the sauce. Sprinkle toasted sesame seeds over the cucumber salad for garnish.</li>
                <li>Serve the smashed cucumber salad with jasmine rice, coconut rice, or any of my rice recipes or noodle recipes.</li>
            </ol>
